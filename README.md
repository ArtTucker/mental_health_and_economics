## Overview of Project Topic:

Mental illness affect millions of adults in the United States.
- Approximately 1 in 5 adults in the U.S. experiences mental illness in a given year.
- Approximately 1 in 25 adults in the U.S. experiences a serious mental health issue that can substantially interfere with major life activities.

Mental health problems are not moral failings. They are common occurrences, and many people need help to get better. Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including:
- Biological factors, such as genes, physical illness, injury, or brain chemistry.
- Life experiences, such as trauma or a history of abuse.
- Family history of mental health problems.

## Reason
Many of us have battled with depression and anxiety issues for most of our lives.

## Source data:
Our team has put a lot of legwork into finding appropriate, adequate datasets that will help us properly explore this topic. Among the sources we've explored are:
* a Kaggle dataset on ...,
* (?) data from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=household%20income%20by%20county&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1902&hidePreview=false) on mean income by US county,
* (?) a dataset from the Kaiser Family Foundation on [Adult Reporting Mental Illness in the Past Year](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/adults-reporting-any-mental-illness-in-the-past-year/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) (for 2018-2019) sorted by state.
* ...

## Questions:
In broad terms our project is centered around these two hypotheses:
1. (?)
2. (?)

## Machine learning model:
(?)

Our current machine learning model can be found [here](https://github.com/ArtTucker/mental_health_and_economics/blob/morales_v_branch/unemployement_random_forest.ipynb). It is built using the Kaggle-sourced "Unemployment and mental illness survey" data noted above.

## Database:

We are using a postgreSQL database. Knowing that we are not going to work with a huge volumes of data, there are more advantages for us to use a relational database management system.
- Data structure.
- Easy access to the network.
- Language (SQL).
- Speed.
- Maintenance.
- Ability to be access by more than one person.

Our current database work can be found [here](https://github.com/ArtTucker/mental_health_and_economics/tree/SylvainDessagnes/Database).
