## Technology anticipated to be used
Broadly speaking, in preparation for our final projects this week we have identified certain data sets.  

Primary dataset sources:
Data - Census.gov <br/>
Adults Reporting Mental Illness in the Past Year ---National Mental Health Services Survey 2019 (N-MHSS-2019-DS0001) <br/>
https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/hhs/health-professional-shortage-areas?project=ucbeconmentalhealth&folder=&organizationId= <br/>
https://data.cdc.gov/NCHS/Indicators-of-Anxiety-or-Depression-Based-on-Repor/8pt5-q6wp <br/>

We used Pandas to initiate the ETL process. Cleaning data, merging multiple datasets and extracting pertinent information is ongoing. We were able to create an ERD using pgAdmin and use the same as our database. 

Our Hypothesis is centered around these questions
1)The rate of Depression/anxiety is higher in lower socio economic class. <br/>
2)There is less mental health resource in lower income states/counties.

At this time - our ML model will be Supervised learning. We hope to see certain trends to predicts suicide Or trends to diagnose Depression. We anticipate using prediction models to identify triggers. 
Depending on our output and what information we use from the data our final presentation may include map ( using Java ) or Tableau. We would also like to explore the data more and see if Tableau can be used to depict other factors such as gender, Race, or job titles affecting Mental Health.
