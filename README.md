# Project Overview
1 out of every 5 adults deals with mental illness. It costs the US about $1 trillion in lost productivity. Despite how common it is, people often avoid support. This analysis examines the technology industry, a market worth $1.6 trillion to ask: what factors contribute to a workplace that feels comfortable and receptive to mental health?
# Methods
This data comes from Open Sourcing Mental Illness, a nonprofit dedicated to raising awareness, educating, and providing resources to support mental wellness in the tech and open-source communities. The survey contains 1,434 responses, and measures attitudes towards mental health among tech workers with and without a mental health disorder. The analysis included 1,004 responses after data cleaning.
Data was filtered or dropped by these criteria:
1.	Dropped rows/respondents by people who work for a company, and are NOT self-employed
2.	Reduced rows/respondents by people who lived in countries where over 30 people contributed to the survey. 
3.	Removed columns/answers to survey questions with over 75% NaN
# Results
Most people identified as male in the survey. 722 respondents (72% of the total number of respondents) identified as male. 259 respondents (26% of the total number of respondents) identified as female. An exceedingly small group identified as non-binary (2%).

\
Most respondents felt comfortable talking about mental health with their supervisors. 95 women (37% of all female respondents) and 272 men (38% of all male respondents) affirmed that they would talk to their supervisor about mental health. This suggests people felt similarly about the matter at hand, regardless of gender. However, ‘yes’, ‘no’, and ‘maybe’ responses appeared almost evenly split into thirds. This demonstrates people overall took varied approaches.
\
\
Despite some inclination to share about their mental health, almost half of all respondents believed that being identified as having a mental health diagnosis would hurt their career. 134 (52%) of women believed a mental health diagnosis either had or would hurt their career. Comparatively, 313 (43%) of men believed a mental health diagnosis either had or would hurt their career. Women feared retribution more than men in this scenario. Figure A demonstrates below:

\
\
Nevertheless, when asked if they had observed co workers receiving negative consequences for revealing a mental health condition, almost 90% of both men and women said ‘no.’ Even though people feared for their careers if they were identified with a mental health condition, they also lacked any observable evidence of others receiving different treatment because of a mental health condition.
\
\
It also appeared respondents did not know if the workplace treated physical health and mental health the same. Just over 40% of men and women said, ‘I don’t know.’ 80 women (31% of female respondents) and 219 men (30% of male respondents) commented, ‘yes.’ Gender did not affect perception in this case. It could be implied that factors, such as uncertainty, rather than observation of workplace practices, such as negative consequences, are influencing people, and their choices about mental health in the workplace.
When asked about awareness of mental health coverage, 412 (41%) of respondents answered, “I am not sure.” Most people, with no difference among men or women, did not know about their workplace’s coverage of mental health. Employers also lacked efforts to spread awareness of resources. 708 (71%) of respondents said their employers had not discussed mental health options. This perception did not vary by gender. 
# Summary
Without information, people make decisions based on their biases, opinions or best guesses. Despite evidence to the contrary, workers believed that if an employer identified them with a mental health condition, then their careers would suffer. This felt more probable for women than men, a possible amplification of women’s minority status in the tech industry. Representing only 1 out every 4 workers, women already face different characterization than men, because of their poorer remonstrance. While workers had not seen negative consequences for a mental health diagnosis among coworkers, they also did not notice employers spreading awareness of mental health resources or coverage. Omission in discussions prevents normalization of the subject. It could be affecting people’s willingness to be identified as having a mental health condition. Even for this survey, only 420 (41%) of the total respondents were willing to answer if they had a current mental health diagnosis.
# Recommendations for Employers
1.	Amplify communication about wellness opportunities to prevent stress from becoming a mental health condition. Normalize mental health by openly discussing it during presentations about resources and health coverage.
2.	Acknowledge and name gender dynamics in the workplace. Women perceive penalization is possible more often than men. More research is needed to understand why, but it starts by naming that men outnumber women dramatically.
3.	Workplace culture is affected by many factors. Psychological safety affects people’s productivity and retention, which has financial consequences. Do right by people. Do right by your bottom line. Consider a corporate social responsibility department. Incorporate data about employee wellness into a part of how the workplace success is defined. Measure it so there’s accountability.
4.	The world is in the middle of a health crisis. Unfortunately, the Covid 19 pandemic represents only part of a large story. Anxiety and depression are on the rise, and people cannot find the help that they need. According to an American Psychological Association poll of nearly 1,800 psychologists, 74 percent said more patients sought treatment for anxiety disorders compared with before the pandemic. Nearly 30 percent of providers reported seeing more patients overall (New York Times, 2021). To meet this crisis, employers must step up. It is not just about changing how we do business, but how we treat staff.
