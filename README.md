# Mental Health and Economics

Topic: An analytical exploration of the connections between mental health and financial wellbeing.

Reason: As someone who has battled with depression and anxiety issues for most of my life, I am well aware of how these issues can be exacerbated by as well as lead to financial hardships. I wanted to further explore this relationship through statistics and numbers.

Source data: Our team has had a lot of struggles with finding appropriate, adequate datasets that will help us properly explore this topic. Among the sources we've explored are:
* a Kaggle dataset on ['Unemployment and mental illness survey](https://www.kaggle.com/michaelacorley/unemployment-and-mental-illness-survey),
* data from [data.census.gov](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?q=household%20income%20by%20county&tid=ACSST1Y2019.S1902&hidePreview=false) on mean income by US county,
* a dataset from the Kaiser Family Foundation on [Adult Reporting Mental Illness in the Past Year](https://www.kff.org/other/state-indicator/adults-reporting-any-mental-illness-in-the-past-year/?currentTimeframe=0&sortModel=%7B%22colId%22:%22Location%22,%22sort%22:%22asc%22%7D) (for 2018-2019) sorted by state.
* a dataset of the [National Mental Health Service Survey 2019](https://www.datafiles.samhsa.gov/study-dataset/national-mental-health-services-survey-2019-n-mhss-2019-ds0001-nid18959) from the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Data Archive (SAMHDA), which collects "statistical information on the services and characteristics of all known mental health treatment facilities" within the United States,
